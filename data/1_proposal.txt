20000A5 Insufficient varnish flow
Description
Both the CoatingStar and the CoatingStar Compact are fitted with eccentric disc pumps for this purpose,
either with 2 C1-pumps or with 2 Âµ-tt-pumps. This is a high-quality, wearfree pump type that is very 
durable under normal conditions. If there are malfunctions in the varnish supply system, they are generally
not caused by the eccentric disc pumps. In most cases, even when there are unusual pump noises or insufficient
varnish quantitites delivered, the malfunction can be eliminated without a replacement of the eccentric disc
 pumps.
 
This document describes the procedures for an analysis and elimination of malfunctions that must be performed
before an eccentric disc pump is replaced.
